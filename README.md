# Station bathymetry
The purpose of the script is to check the bathymetry surrounding the station and avoid drifting upgradient into the topography. The resolution of the bathymetry used here is often higher than the one of the nautical charts available onboard. 

This script returns a contour plot of the bathymetry around a station speficied by the user (within a 6nm radius from the selected station). It also plots the station position (as a red triangle) and a half-mile radius around the station, which is usually how much the ship can drift during a deep (~4000 m) station.
